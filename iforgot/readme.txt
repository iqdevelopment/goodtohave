I Forgot v1.0a

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
Works on Microsoft Win32 OSes, but I don't support Win95 or WinNT4
Tested on Win98SE, Win2000, and WinXP

DESCRIPTION:
Ever had those times where you had a password stored for one of your many
accounts and then you forgot that password? Well then, this program is for
you. It can be used to retrieve passwords which are hidden behind the "*"
character or the bullet character in WinXP.

USAGE:
On the main dialog, you will see a magnifying glass. Left click and hold down
until your cursor changes into the magnifying glass and the icon in the dialog
becomes a monkey's face (do not release the mouse button yet). Drag the
magnifying glass cursor over the password field. The password field is either
masked with asterisks or bullet points, depending which operating system you are
using. If the program has successfully detected a password field, then two
things will happen--The password masking character will be removed from the
password field so the underlying text is displayed AND the password will be
copied to the edit field in I Forgot's dialog. Also included is an example JPG of what
the program will do when it retrieves a password.


FAQ:
Q: The program won't run; it says I'm missing such and such DLL.
A: In order to run the program, you will need the PasswdHook.dll. Any other DLL
    is probably one for Microsoft Foundation Class, search using
    http://www.google.com/

Q: When I retrieve a password, change the text, and place the magnifying glass
     over that password field again, nothing is copied to I Forgot. What gives?
A: By design--once you have retrieved a password, I temporarily remove the
    passwork masking character, which basically means that the field is no longer a
    password field.

Q: How do I do <insert your tech support question here>?
A: Re-read the USAGE section of this file. If you still can't figure out how to
    use it, get a friend to help you. DO NOT e-mail me with tech-support type
    questions as I will just delete them. You are not paying for this program so
    don't expect tech support for it.
